    - [x] Write executable: Ensure all edge cases are covered
    - [x] Verify: `poetry run pytest`, manual test

#### Final Workflow Summary
- Tasks can be completed and reviewed. If rejected, they are marked with `is_approved = false` and remain assigned to the same user.
- Rejected tasks are shown in "Current Task Assignments" with a clear marker ("Rejected: Please redo").
- Rejected tasks are not shown in "Recent Completion History".
- When redone, marking as complete resets `is_approved` to `null` and updates `completed_at`.
- All logic uses only `is_approved` and `completed_at`â€”no extra fields needed.

### Frontend Alignment to Backend API (Plan)
1. Inventory backend endpoints (from `api_setup.sql`, `init.sql`)
2. Map frontend data needs to backend endpoints
3. Update API calls in frontend to match backend
4. Test and validate dashboard data loading

### ðŸŸ¦ Detailed Checklist: Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Design

- [ ] **Preparation**
    - [ ] List all tables requiring RLS
    - [ ] Identify all access patterns (read, write, update, delete) for each table

- [ ] **Policy Design**
    - [ ] Write `SELECT` policies for each table (who can read which rows?)
    - [ ] Write `INSERT` policies (who can create which rows? Use `WITH CHECK` as needed)
    - [ ] Write `UPDATE` policies (who can update which rows? Use `USING` and `WITH CHECK`)
    - [ ] Write `DELETE` policies (who can delete which rows?)
    - [ ] Use session variables/JWT claims for user scoping (e.g., `current_setting('jwt.claims.user_id', true)`)
    - [ ] Add policies for special cases (e.g., admin, soft delete, multi-tenancy)
- [ ] **Testing**
    - [ ] Write tests for allowed and forbidden access for each policy (pytest or PgTap)
    - [ ] Test edge cases (e.g., missing claims, invalid roles)
    - [ ] Run full regression suite after policy changes
- [ ] **Review**
    - [ ] Peer review all policies for logic errors or overly broad access
    - [ ] Document policy rationale in code or docs

    - [ ] Test RLS and API endpoints with/without valid JWTs
- [ ] **Security**
    - [ ] Rotate JWT secrets regularly
    - [ ] Set reasonable token expiry (`exp` claim)
    - [ ] Never store sensitive data in JWT payload
