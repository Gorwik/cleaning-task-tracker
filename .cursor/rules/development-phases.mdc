# Mandatory Development Phases & Verification Gates

## Phase 1: Research & Planning (MANDATORY)
**Must be completed before any code implementation**

1. **Define Requirements** - Update [README.md](mdc:README.md) with precise business requirements
2. **Build Knowledge Base** - Research and document in [KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md](mdc:KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md)
3. **USER VERIFICATION GATE** - Present knowledge base and wait for explicit approval

## Phase 2: Test-Driven Implementation
**One feature at a time**

1. **Write Tests First** - Create comprehensive test coverage
2. **Implement Feature** - Minimum code to make tests pass
3. **User Verification** - Pause for user review of approach and code
4. **Run All Tests** - Ensure no regressions
5. **USER VERIFICATION GATE** - Present results and wait for approval

## Phase 3: Troubleshooting & Quality
**Only if tests fail**

1. **Isolate Failures** - Fix one test at a time
2. **Iterate Carefully** - Make targeted changes
3. **Prevent Regressions** - Revert if changes break existing tests
4. **Handle Persistent Failures** - Stop and ask for guidance after 2-3 attempts

## Subphase Completion Protocol
**After each subphase:**
1. **STOP and BREAK**
2. **Explain** what was implemented and rationale
3. **Allow** user to read and ask questions
4. **Wait** for approval before proceeding

## Progress Tracking
- Mark completed tasks as resolved in [README.md](mdc:README.md)
- Update [KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md](mdc:KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md) with new findings
- Document any deviations from original plan
