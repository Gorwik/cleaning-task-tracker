# Tool Usage Guidelines & Research Priorities

## Research Tool Priority Order
1. **codebase_search** - For semantic search within the project
2. **grep_search** - For exact text/pattern matching
3. **file_search** - For finding specific files
4. **read_file** - For examining file contents

## Research Source Priority
1. **Official Documentation** (postgrest.org, postgresql.org, hub.docker.com)
2. **Official GitHub Repositories** with examples
3. **Existing project files** for patterns and examples

## Tool Usage Guidelines
- Use `codebase_search` for understanding existing code patterns
- Use `grep_search` for finding specific function names, table names, or exact text
- Use `read_file` to examine specific files when detailed context is needed
- Use `file_search` when you know part of a filename but not exact location

## Knowledge Base Management
- Always update [KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md](mdc:KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md) with new research findings
- Keep knowledge base organized by technology/topic
- Include both working examples and common error patterns
- Document concrete code examples that are directly applicable

## When Research is Insufficient
If after thorough search you cannot find sufficient information or clear examples:
- **STOP** and ask the user for help
- Do not proceed with implementation without adequate knowledge
